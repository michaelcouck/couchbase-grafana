## TypeScript Couchbase data source For Grafana (in development, please contribute :))

This is just a starting point for writing plugins for Grafana, nothing works, but the outline is there and the plugin is deployed to Grafana.

Included:

- Karma and mocha for unit testing in TypeScript
- Mocks for testing and TypeScript typings to be able to compile the plugin.
- A basic Grunt script to build the plugin. Builds TypeScript and copies the required files to the dist directory.
